Hello, and welcome to my modest corner of the web!
I am Manojna, the author and creator of Sambhashya.

**Sambhashya** in Sanskrit means "discourse" or "debate".
This is a simple technical blog to share my meagre knowledge
with the world and learn more from the comments.

Sambhashya is my personal blog which contains scribblings
and ramblings on various topics in the field of technology.

there are no sponsorships, and there are no commissions.
If it's written here, you can be assured no one has
requested, demanded, approved, endorsed, or paid for the
content you see. This is the way I wish to keep it.

# Privacy

Privacy is a huge concern for all of us, and rightly so.
As a result, **Sambhashya** does not employ tracking cookies
