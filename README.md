# Sambhashya

**Sambhashya** in Sanskrit means "discourse" or "debate".
This is a simple technical blog to share my meagre knowledge
with the world and learn more from the comments.

Sambhashya is my personal blog which contains scribblings
and ramblings on various topics in the field of technology.
